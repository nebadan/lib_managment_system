## Library Management System

## Description
This Library Management System is designed to handle all the information of books and activities of the users associated with the library. 
It provides all the basic features such as addition, updating, deletion, and viewing of book records. A user can issue or return a book. 
All activities by users, like issuing or returning of books, are managed and tracked using Aspect-Oriented Programming.
The system also applies one of the best practices: Dependency Injection for service and repository classes.

## Features

- **Issue and Return Books:** Keep track of book transactions by issuing and returning books to users.
- **Log User Activities:** Using AOP, log user activities regarding the issue/return of a book for auditing and tracking purposes.
- **Dependency Injection (DI): ** It is used for service and repository classes to bring in better modularity and testability.
